# KeyLoggers-using-Python![keylogger-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80483699/231238881-542a756c-7a17-4129-b116-be1be380cf6a.png)

In a keylogger attack, the keylogger software records every keystroke on the victim's device and sends it to the attacker. An infamous keylogger attack uses a type of malware called DarkHotel. Hackers target unsecured Wi-Fi at hotels and prompt users to download the software.

In this Project, We have implemented a basic version of Keylogger where it will capture the vitcim's Key stroke with their Knowledge
It can be upgraded to capture them without vitcim's knowledge. But since this is for educational purpose, I have not implemented this method due to security purposes.

While accessing this Keylogger file, a command prompt will be opened and begin to capture the key strokes.
Captured Keystrokes will be saved in the Main file location under the name of Captures.txt
